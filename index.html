        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm an experienced software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my three years in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and I love working with a team. I've also had the opportunity to serve as the software engineer lead for three projects with my institute.
            <br><br>
I serve as a co-ordinator in Coding Wizard Club and contribute in the projects and problem solving abilities of the club members. While working there, I committed to web app development and dsa skills, which has been my specialty for two years. I understand that a major part of this role with my club focuses on developing brains of my teams, which my previous experience has certainly prepared me for.
        </p>
