        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an 20-year-old from India and I am currently a freshman studying Computer Science at ITER, SOA. I am frequently known by user name beginner_at_code.

I have been programming since I was 13 years old when I was first introuced to Java and I absolutely love it. I also have a lot of experience in Competitive Programming.
            <br><br>
I serve as a co-ordinator in Coding Wizard Club and contribute in the projects and problem solving abilities of the club members. While working there, I committed to web app development and dsa skills, which has been my specialty for two years. I understand that a major part of this role with my club focuses on developing brains of my teams, which my previous experience has certainly prepared me for.
